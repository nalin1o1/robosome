<h1>Introduction to Programming </h1>

In this session, we learn about <br> <br>

(a) Command<br> <br>

(b) Syntax<br> <br>

(c) Arguments<br> <br>

(d) Operational logic

<h2>Commands:</h2>

A command is a fundamental unit of information (or keyword) that is provided to a machine (like a Robot), that can be understood and acted upon by the machine. 

<br><br>
Examples of a command are - "start", "stop".
<br><br>
A command can indicate a complete action by itself, or can have additional parameters (Arguments) that provided supporting information to the command.
<br><br>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<br><br>
Syntax is a pre-defined order or sequence of commands, with precise recommendations of how the commands should be sent. Commands sent to a machine, need to follow this specific syntax. Only then, the machine can be guaranteed to behave as expected by the command.
<br><br>
<h2>Argument:</h2>
<br><br>
An argument is a supporting parameter to a command, that provides additional information to the command to make it unique. Consider the command "start motors". The first keyword "start" is a command, followed by an additional argument "motors" that indicates that the machine should start both motors simultaneously. There can be many arguments to a command.
<br><br>
<h2>Program and Logic:</h2>
<br><br>
A program is a sequence of one or more commands, that together result in a meaningful operation performed by the machine. For example, using a sequence of simple commands, a machine (Robot) can be made to move through a maze, or perform more complex operations. Usually, there is a logic involved in creating a program. For example, there can be many ways of going through a maze, but only one way can be successful. To find out this path, a logic has to be applied in the program (ex, go left, or go right) to perform the task correctly.
